# introduction <br>
Introduction page - web project for CIS 370 <br> <br>
Greetings fellow classmates. <br> <br>
I used to dabble in HTML back in the days of MySpace. <br>
There was a time when I enjoyed learning about HTML and the cool things you can do with a webpage. <br> <br>
My skills are super limited, but I hope to relearn some of the basics, work on my code structure, and catch up on available technologies.

This is a <em> <u> horizontal rule </u> </em>. <br>
Note to self:  the /u tag is obsolete. <br>
I was tyring to underline some text, but I seem to be struggling with it. <br>
Wait... now I'm confused... <u> The /u tag shows up properly on the webpage, but not in the preview. </u>

I believe that playing around with your assignments and adding in additinal features is the best way to learn.

Here's another cool fact, I work in the Military Science Department as the Scholarship and Enrollment Officer. <br>
This is also a good opportunity for me to learn some additional skills to help maintain our web presence.

This seems like a good place for me to throw out that I can help you pay for college...  ;-)
