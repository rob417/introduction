Greetings fellow classmates. </br> </br>
I used to dabble in HTML back in the days of MySpace. </br>
There was a time when I enjoyed learning about HTML and the cool things you can do with a webpage. </br> </br>
My skills are super limited, but I hope to relearn some of the basics, work on my code structure, and catch up on available technologies.  </br> </br>
<H1> Military Science </H1>

Here's another cool fact, I work in the Military Science Department as the Scholarship and Enrollment Officer. </br>
This is also a good opportunity for me to learn some additional skills to help maintain our web presence.

This seems like a good place for me to throw out that I can help you pay for college...  ;-)
